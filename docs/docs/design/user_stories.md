# User stories

User stories describe the goals and motivations of different user roles when
interacting with the app. Each story captures a specific need or objective from
the user’s perspective, helping to define what functionality the system should
support and why it matters. Writing user stories ensures that development
remains focused on delivering value and usability to real users.
